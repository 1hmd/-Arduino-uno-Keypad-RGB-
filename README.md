# -Arduino-uno-Keypad-RGB-
It is coded for an Arduino board with a keypad that controls RGB LED lights and has a spam mode feature that changes LED colors repeatedly when a key is held down. It includes a Keypad library and defines variables for the keypad layout and pinouts, as well as functions for controlling the LED lights. An array is used to track which key is holding to determine the LED color, and the code checks for key presses and toggles spam mode.
It is important to note that this code is not perfect and can be improved. 

NOTE: You don't need the ``key.cpp`` and ``key.h``
